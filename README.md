### One author can have many books, one book can have multiple authors, but it can only belong to one category. Supply the database in any way (SQL queries or via Java).
### Create a REST service which will return data:
### - Author
### - Information on how many books the author has in a given category.
### Then create an index.html file that will display this data downloaded from the REST service.
